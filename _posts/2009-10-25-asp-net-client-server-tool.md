This is a tool I whipped up. Its a simple one-click application that acts as a localhost server and runs an asp.net application.

The core works fine without any crashes yet. I need to do a few improvements so I can submit my game in 1 package and start the project without navigating to it. Stay tuned for more updates on this little application.

The download is located on the left in a Box.net widget. The file is called XorianaServer.exe.

<strong>Requirements:</strong>

My machine is vista sp2 and I've tested it on a windows 7 also. But this is what I think it requires:

.NET 3.5 SP1.

<strong>Official Description:</strong>

Xoriana Server is a local client server that can run ASP.NET 3.5 and under projects the same way visual studio's internal server does. Â (WebDev.WebServer.exe) There are many servers like this around including those used by commercial 3rd party control creators such as Telerik, ComponentOne and Infragistics. This is where I got my idea from.

<strong>Instructions:</strong>
Start XorianaServer.exe.
Browse to the root path of where you project is located. That is for example, the folder that Default.aspx is located.
There is a default port and virtual path set, if they are already in use, you can change them.

<strong>License</strong>:
Anyone is free to use this tool, distribute it or whatever.

<strong>Future Updates:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>GUI tuneup, icons, etc.</li>
	<li>Parameter Passing.</li>
	<li>Minimize to System Tray.</li>
	<li>Memory Optimization. (This currently uses 23MB+ Ram)</li>
</ol>
