Today is sunday, the finals is Saturday and I'm still coding. No presentation script has been written for the demo as yet. We have our storyboard and outline for the demo. I need to upload our Azure project to the live windows azure server and our silverlight application into the live mesh and do some testing against those.

What needs to be done for finals:
<ol>
	<li>Complete local and live testing.</li>
	<li>Implement Crop rotation in the map.</li>
	<li>Configure map backend to work with elastic farming logic.</li>
	<li>Hook up live data to Farm and Crop Tab.</li>
	<li>Complete Crop Adding for Advanced.</li>
	<li>Setup PDA alerts tab with Mesh.</li>
</ol>
All of this can be done in the next 3 days if i do not sleep... else, I'll be coding on the plane to Egypt ...
