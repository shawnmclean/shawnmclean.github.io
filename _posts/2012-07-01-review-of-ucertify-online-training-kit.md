A few months ago I reviewed <a href="http://www.shawnmclean.com/review-of-ucertify-asp-net-web-applications-development-training-kit/">ASP.NET Web Applications Development Training Kit</a> from <a href="https://learn.ucertify.com/">uCertify</a>, now they have an online version of this toolkit available. At first glance, I must say there is a very BIG improvement in the interface, it looks so googlely now and easier to navigate. There are a few new features also, such as Flash Cards, Book and Study Planner.

The Book is a nice feature and better organizes the reference materials than the desktop version. You get a list of chapters, the option to select the notes or do practise quizzes or tests for that chapter and a mini preparation report of how much percentage you learnt and mastered. My last review gave Tests a score of 10/10, I wish I can give this version a higher score due to the improvements made. Tests now have 3 category types, <strong>Test Mode</strong> which lets you review answers at the end of the test, <strong>Learn Mode </strong>which provides you with feedback immediately after each question and <strong>Review </strong><strong>Mode</strong> which lets you review all the questions and explanations without taking the test.

The Study Planner feature is the biggest feature added so far with a progress report that  tells us your target, your preparation and reference materials covered right up to the day of the exam. On the page, I was greeted with a progress bar and this awesome statement: `<em>Your preparation is about 0.5% complete. You took 1 days to complete 0.5%. At this pace you will need another 6 Months, 2 Weeks, 5 Days, to be fully prepared for your final (exam).</em>` You can take tests and view references of various categories from this page also. Great new feature.
<h2> Conclusion</h2>
Its good to see that the company not only just add new content but continuously work on their learning management systems to have a better learning environment and experience for the user. I'm also happy to see that they are placing more focus on UI as it represents the environment of a class room. A clean and modern UI represents a clean and modern class room which makes us learn better.
