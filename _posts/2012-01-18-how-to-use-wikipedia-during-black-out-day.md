I'm so disappointed in how wikipedia went about their so called 'black-out day' to protest against SOPA. Instead of a server side redirect, they used client side?

<strong>Turn Javascript off. </strong>In Chrome, you can browse to this settings page: <em>chrome://settings/contentExceptions#javascript </em>and enter <em>http://en.wikipedia.org/ </em>as one of the Hostname Pattern and set it to <em>Block. </em>Remove this tomorrow.

<strong>Use cached versions from google. </strong>Most of you will find wikipedia articles from google. Click <em>cached</em> and you will have access to that data.
