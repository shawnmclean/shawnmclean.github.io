The web is becoming mobile, major websites are creating a mobile version of their system and new sites are also starting out as mobile only first. Thus, I shall not be left behind and have recently finished reading the<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/html5-mobile-development-for-iphone5-android-blackberry-cookbook/book"> HTML5 Mobile Development Cookbook</a>, over 200 pages of in-depth explanations, source codes and pictures of building various features for mobile browsers. This book is like an All In One book of tutorials and articles packaged together is proper sequence. Setting up test environment (not development environment), browser support for features and interacting with various phone OS APIs are some of the most notable topic.

I really loved the support for browsers such as opera mini and old Operating Systems such as Symbian. There is even a whole chapter on debugging on these systems and newer systems. Remote debugging  in javascript, html and CSS (If you consider it debugging with HTML and CSS). Performance testing on these platforms also stands out for me as I am more of an engineer and not specifically a designer. The book utilize a combination of local software tools and online tools for testing. They range from basic tools such as using Google Analyzer to more advance tools such as WireShark.

What I love the most about this book? They gave instructions on setting up your environment for major mobile devices, where to find the required files AND what desktop OS you can develop and test on. For example, testing in an Android emulator, the URL to download the emulator and what supported OS you can test on (Windows, Mac and Linux). I've had so much trouble in the past to find and set-up reliable test environments for mobile development. My designer friend <a href="https://twitter.com//DwayneSamuels">Dwayne Samuels</a> even took a look at the Table of Contents and already found a solution to a problem he is currently having (changing layout based on phone's orientation).  I recommend all web front-end engineers and designers to have a look at this book.
